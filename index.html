        <h1 id="salutation">Welcome to the Monty Hall Problem demo!</h1>

        <div id="description">
            <p>The Monty Hall Problem is named after the host of a popular television game show created in the 1960's.
                Monty Hall would present contestants with three doors, each hiding something.
                Behind two of these doors were "Zonks," or concession prizes, while the third door often had a shiny new sports car.</p>
            <p>The contestant was instructed to select one door; Monty would then reveal a Zonk behind one of the
            the remaining two doors and ask the contestant if they would like to keep the door they originally chose,
            or swap to the remaining door.</p>
            <p>Statistically, it is always a better decision to swap to the other door.  Unfortunately, this is not
            necessarily intuitive which has led to years of debate and discussion.  This website aims to
            exemplify why one choice is better (or worse) than the other.</p>

                <p>To illustrate how important it is to always swap to the remaining door we can alter the game slightly.</p>
                <p>In these examples, the game will have 100 doors instead of 3, and Monty will reveal every single door except one.
                    It's important to remember that he obviously can't reveal the door with the car; he can only reveal Zonks.
                    This makes the collapse of the odds for the car into the final door <em>extremely</em> obvious.</p>
                <p>Another way of looking at it is to ask what the odds are that you chose the car on your first pick:
                    1 in 100 for this case.  Still want to stay on that door?</p>
