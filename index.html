    <h1 id="salutation">Welcome to the Monty Hall Problem demo!</h1>

    <div id="description">
        <p>The Monty Hall Problem is named after a popular television game show created in the 1960's.
            It's named for the show's host, who would present contestants with three doors, each hiding a prize.
            Behind two of these doors were "Zonks," or concession prizes, while the third door often had a shiny new sports car.</p>
        <p>The contestant was then instructed to select one door; Monty would then reveal a Zonk behind one of the
        the remaining two doors and ask the contestant if they would like to keep the door they originally chose,
        or switch to the remaining door.</p>
        <p>Statistically, it is a better decision to always switch to the other door.  Unfortunately, this is not
        always intuitive, which has led to years of debate and discussion.  This website aims to
        exemplify why one choice is better (or worse) than the other.</p>
